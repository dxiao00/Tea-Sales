# Tea-Sales
Bayesian models for predicting future green tea and milk tea sales.

I work at a restaurant where one of my responsibilities is to make tea orders as they come in.
To help me with my job, I want to create a model to predict daily tea sales to help me meet customer
demands. If my model predicts that many customers will order tea today, I would want to prepare more tea
in advance. On the other hand, if my model predicts that only a few customers will order tea today, then I
would not want to prepare so much tea to minimize waste.

The main two types of tea are green tea and milk tea. Green teas are flavored but every different type uses 
jasmine tea as a base. Milk teas come in multiple flavors and the preparation and ingredients are different
for each. Thus, we want to know the sales for green tea and milk tea separately and the sales for each type
of milk tea separately. Two separate models were created for this purpose.
